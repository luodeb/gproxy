title: First Request
description: Send OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, Claude Messages, and Gemini requests through GPROXY, stream them, list models, use the named prefix, and find the request afterwards.
---

GPROXY answers on the native paths of each accepted wire format. A user API key
authenticates the caller; the public model name selects the route, and
its members, permissions, quotas, rules, and credentials decide where the
request goes. The examples assume a public model name `main` and a key
`sk-<your-key>` created as in the [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/).

## Authentication

Send the key in any of these headers, on any path:

```text
Authorization: Bearer sk-<your-key>
x-api-key: sk-<your-key>
x-goog-api-key: sk-<your-key>
```

The key must be enabled and unexpired, and it needs an allow permission for
the provider the request resolves to.

## OpenAI Chat Completions

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-<your-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "main",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Say hello." }
    ]
  }'
```

## OpenAI Responses

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-<your-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "main",
    "input": "Say hello."
  }'
```

## Claude Messages

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: sk-<your-key>" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "main",
    "max_tokens": 256,
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Say hello." }
    ]
  }'
```

## Gemini GenerateContent

Gemini carries the model in the path:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1beta/models/main:generateContent" \
  -H "x-goog-api-key: sk-<your-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contents": [
      { "parts": [ { "text": "Say hello." } ] }
    ]
  }'
```

If the route's member speaks another format, GPROXY converts the
request on the way out and the response on the way back. The client sees its
own format in every case.

## Streaming

For OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, and Claude Messages, add `"stream": true`
to the body; the response is server-sent events in that format's own event
shape:

```bash
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-<your-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "model": "main", "stream": true,
        "messages": [ { "role": "user", "content": "Count to five." } ] }'
```

For Gemini, call `:streamGenerateContent`. Without a query the stream is
Gemini's incremental JSON array; `?alt=sse` selects server-sent events:

```bash
curl -N "http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1beta/models/main:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse" \
  -H "x-goog-api-key: sk-<your-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "contents": [ { "parts": [ { "text": "Count to five." } ] } ] }'
```

OpenAI Responses is also served over WebSocket: an upgrade request to
`GET /v1/responses` opens a session that goes through the same admission and
settlement as an HTTP call.

## Listing Models

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-<your-key>"
```

`GET /v1/models` answers in the OpenAI or Claude shape, `GET /v1beta/models`
in the Gemini shape, and `GET /v1/models/{id}` returns one entry. The list
contains the public model names and variants the key may use. Providers whose
`auto_refresh_models` setting is on (the default) are asked
for their catalogue concurrently. Listing is answered by the gateway itself,
still passes admission, and records a zero-cost settlement.

## The Named Prefix

Putting a target name in the first path segment selects it directly, and the
rest of the path is the native path:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/openai-main/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-<your-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
    "messages": [ { "role": "user", "content": "Say hello." } ]
  }'
```

| First segment | Effect on `model` |
| --- | --- |
| A provider name, such as `openai-main` | `model` is the upstream model id. The provider's credential pool is used directly; load-balancer selection is skipped. |
| A route name | The route's members are used as in aggregated mode. |
| A namespace, such as `openai` for a public model `openai/gpt-4.1` | `model` is the part after the slash. |

Named requests still authenticate the key, check permissions against the
selected provider, apply its rule sets, select a credential, and settle usage.
A first segment that matches nothing is treated as part of an aggregated path.
Codex CLI uses this form: the portal's connection snippet points it at
`/codex/backend-api/...` and `/codex/oauth/...`.

## Errors

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | The path or operation is not supported, or the request body is invalid. |
| `401` | The key is missing, unknown, disabled, or expired. |
| `402` | A cost quota is exhausted. |
| `403` | The key has no allow permission for the resolved provider, or a deny applies. |
| `404` | The public model name, route, or provider does not exist. |
| `413` | The request body exceeds the 100 MiB limit. |
| `429` | A rate limit was hit; `retry_after_secs` is in the body. |
| `502` | No usable credential, or every upstream attempt failed. |

Error bodies use the OpenAI envelope: `{"error":{"message":"..."}}`.

## Finding the Request Afterwards

Every response carries an `x-request-id` header of the form
`<instance-id>-<random>-<sequence>`. Afterwards:

- `GET /admin/api/usage-records` lists individual settlements with requests,
  input and output tokens, cache reads and writes, and settled cost, filtered
  by provider, credential, user, key, or model; `GET /admin/api/usage`
  aggregates the same over a range.
- `GET /admin/api/logs` lists each client request with every
  upstream call it produced, filtered by user, key, provider, status, or
  request id; `GET /admin/api/logs/<request_id>` returns one exchange. Headers
  and bodies appear only when the corresponding capture switches are on in
  `PATCH /admin/api/log-settings` or `/admin/api/instance-settings`, and are
  redacted unless redaction is disabled there.
- `GET /admin/api/audit` records admin API changes and channel sign-ins.

Users who sign in to `/portal` see their own usage and, when the operator has
enabled `recent_requests_enabled` via `PATCH /admin/api/portal-settings`, a
**Recent settled requests** table with provider, operation, upstream model,
tokens, cost, and latency — never request or response bodies.
