title: "Providers & Credentials"
description: "Channels, providers, credential pools, login flows, token refresh, health tracking, and provider tooling through the admin API"
---

A **channel** is a compiled-in adapter for one upstream API family. A
**provider** is a saved connection that uses a channel: a name, settings, and a
pool of credentials. Create as many providers per channel as you need, for
example `openai-main` and `openai-eu` both on the `openai` channel.

Changes saved through the admin API apply to new requests without a restart.

## Channels

The channel list comes from the running binary: `GET /admin/api/channels`.
Each channel
declares its display name, the routes it can serve, the provider settings it
accepts, the credential fields it needs, and whether it offers a login flow.
The 28 channel ids, grouped by credential shape:

| Credential shape | Channel ids |
| --- | --- |
| API key (`api_key`) | `aistudio`, `azure`, `claudeapi`, `cloudflare-ai-gateway`, `custom`, `dashscope`, `deepseek`, `nvidia`, `openai`, `openrouter`, `vercel`, `vertexexpress`, `xai` |
| API key or OAuth token | `cline`, `kimi`, `opencode` |
| OAuth token (`access_token`, `refresh_token`) | `claudecode`, `codex`, `grokbuild`, `kiro`, `workbuddy` |
| Google OAuth (`access_token`, `refresh_token`, `project_id`) | `antigravity`, `geminicli` |
| Google service account (`client_email`, `private_key`, `project_id`) | `vertex` |
| AWS (`api_key`, or `access_key_id` + `secret_access_key` + optional `session_token`) | `aws-bedrock` |
| GitHub token (`github_token`) | `copilotcli` |
| Browser cookie (`cookie`, `account_uuid`) | `claudeweb` (native builds only) |

Two v2 id pairs are canonicalized on import: `kimiapi` and `kimicode` become
`kimi`; `opencodezen` and `opencodego` become `opencode` with `tier` set to
`zen` or `go`. `claudeweb` is not compiled into edge builds.

## Provider Fields

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Route name (`name`) | Unique identifier. It is also the named prefix in URLs, for example `/openai-main/v1/chat/completions`. |
| Display name (`label`) | Optional, for the operator's own reference. |
| Channel | One of the ids above. Fixed after creation. |
| Credential strategy | `round_robin` (default) or `sticky`. See below. |
| Provider proxy URL | Overrides the instance proxy for this provider. Credentials can override it again. |
| Client fingerprint | Optional TLS/HTTP profile: a preset or custom JSON. Credentials can override it. |
| Forwarded metadata | Which caller headers and query parameters pass upstream, and which response headers return. Defaults come from the channel. |
| Enabled | Disabled providers leave routing. |

### Channel Settings

Settings are stored as one JSON object. The channel declares typed fields for
the common keys; everything else is reachable by editing the provider's
`settings` JSON directly.

| Key | Channels | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base_url` | all | Upstream origin used when no exact endpoint override exists. |
| `auto_refresh_models` | all | Ask this provider for its live model list when a client lists models. Default `true`. |
| `endpoints` | all | Exact URL per operation kind. See below. |
| `enable_openai_magic_cache` | `openai`, `codex`, `azure`, `custom`, `openrouter`, `vercel`, `opencode` | Recognize the cache trigger strings on OpenAI targets. |
| `enable_claude_magic_cache` | `claudeapi`, `claudecode`, `azure`, `custom`, `openrouter`, `vercel`, `aws-bedrock`, `opencode` | Recognize the cache trigger strings on Claude targets. |
| `claude_fallback_mode`, `claude_fallback_models` | `claudeapi`, `claudecode`, `custom`, `openrouter`, `vercel` | `off`, `default`, or `models` with an ordered list. |
| `region`, `video_output_s3_uri` | `aws-bedrock` | AWS region; S3 destination for generated video. |
| `region`, `profile_arn`, `auth_base_url` | `kiro` | AWS region, profile ARN, authentication origin. |
| `location`, `oauth_client_id`, `oauth_client_secret`, `oauth_token_url` | `vertex`, `antigravity`, `geminicli` | Google Cloud region and OAuth client overrides. |
| `tier`, `console_base_url` | `opencode` | `zen` or `go`; vendor origin for device login. |

Exact endpoint overrides live under `endpoints`, keyed by operation kind, and
take precedence over `base_url`. No path is appended; `{model}` is replaced
with the upstream model id:

```json
{
  "endpoints": {
    "openai_chat_completions": "https://api.example/v1/chat/completions",
    "gemini_generate_content": "https://api.example/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent"
  }
}
```

A credential's `secret` accepts any of the kinds the channel can serve. Common keys are
`openai_chat_completions`, `openai_responses`, `claude_messages`,
`gemini_generate_content`, `gemini_stream_generate_content`,
`openai_list_models`, `openai_embeddings`, `image_generations`.

## Credentials

A credential belongs to one provider and carries:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Label | Optional; use it to identify the upstream account. |
| Kind | `api_key`, `oauth`, or `cookie`. Records how the secret was obtained. |
| Secret | A single key pasted as-is, or a JSON object with the channel's declared fields. Editing prefills the stored secret; leaving it blank keeps the stored value. |
| Traffic weight | Default 100. Share of traffic inside the pool. |
| Requests per minute, Tokens per minute | Optional per-credential ceilings. |
| Proxy override URL | Replaces the provider and instance proxy for this credential. |
| Client fingerprint | Replaces the provider fingerprint. |
| Enabled | Disabled credentials are skipped. |

Secrets are sealed at rest when a master key is configured (see
[Configuration](/reference/configuration/)). Reading a stored secret back is a
separate, audited action (`POST /admin/api/credentials/<id>/reveal`).

### Pool Strategy

Selection is a deterministic counter rotation, never random.

| Strategy | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `round_robin` | Each request advances a counter per route member; the counter picks a credential in proportion to weight. |
| `sticky` | The slot is derived from the caller's API key (or its session id when the client sends one), so one key stays on one credential until the pool changes. |

### Per-Credential Limits

RPM and TPM are enforced in fixed 60-second windows through the cache backend.
TPM counts the request's input tokens with the tokenizer ladder before the
upstream call. A request over either limit fails with `429` and does not
consume the window. These limits protect an upstream account; caller limits
live in [Permissions, Rate Limits & Quotas](/guides/permissions/).

### Health

Health is recorded per (credential, upstream model) from the upstream
response: `2xx` marks healthy, `429` and `5xx` mark degraded, `401`-`403` mark
dead. A failed token refresh marks the whole credential degraded; a malformed
secret marks it dead. Degraded credentials sort after healthy ones in the same
tier; dead ones are removed from the plan. A newer observation replaces the
older one, and observations recorded against a previous credential version are
ignored, so re-saving the secret starts clean. `GET /admin/api/credentials`
reports the worst current state, the abnormal models and the last status and
detail; `POST /admin/api/credentials/<id>/health-reset` clears it.

### Token Refresh

Channels that hold OAuth tokens declare when a secret is due. Refresh runs
under an exclusive 60-second lease in the cache, so concurrent requests refresh
once; the other requests poll every second and pick up the new version. The
rotated secret is persisted with a version guard. Claude rotates the refresh
token on every refresh, so this path must never lose a write.

## Login Flows

Two channels acquire their first credential through the login routes:

| Channel | Modes |
| --- | --- |
| `codex` | Browser sign-in (authorization code + PKCE), Device code |
| `claudecode` | Browser sign-in (authorization code + PKCE), Browser cookie (native builds only) |

- **Browser sign-in**: GPROXY builds the authorization URL with an S256 PKCE
  challenge and state (`POST /admin/api/login/authcode/start`). Approve in the
  browser, then complete it with the full callback URL
  (`POST /admin/api/login/authcode/complete`). The code exchange stores access
  and refresh tokens.
- **Device code**: `POST /admin/api/login/device/start` returns a user code
  and the vendor verification page; `/device/poll` waits until the vendor
  reports approval or denial.
- **Browser cookie**: `POST /admin/api/login/cookie` takes the full `Cookie`
  header or the `sessionKey`
  value. GPROXY discovers the organization, runs the OAuth exchange with the
  cookie, and keeps the cookie sealed for re-login when the tokens expire.

Every other channel takes a pasted key or token.

## Credential spending limits

Set independent total, monthly, weekly, and daily USD caps by creating a
`quotas` row scoped to the credential (`POST /admin/api/quotas` with
`subject_kind: "credential"`, the credential's `subject_id`, and the
`quota_total`, `quota_monthly`, `quota_weekly`, and `quota_daily` fields).
Leave a field blank for unlimited spend;
zero immediately blocks paid requests. Reaching any cap excludes that credential
from new paid attempts. Routing may select another credential; if every candidate
is exhausted, the request returns HTTP 402. Free operations remain available.

Limits use gateway model pricing and begin counting when configured. Missing
model pricing blocks paid requests on a limited credential. Counters persist
independently of usage logging; disabling enforcement keeps counting, and editing
limits preserves existing spend. Total spend never resets automatically. Daily,
weekly, and monthly caps reset at 00:00 UTC each day, Monday, and the first of the
month respectively. Reset times are UTC; the portal renders them in the
viewer's local timezone.

Before a paid request is sent, its estimated cost (input tokens at the model's
price) is reserved against the credential's windows, so concurrent requests
see each other and cannot together overrun a cap by more than the difference
between estimates and settled cost; the reservation is released when the
request settles or is abandoned. Output tokens are only known at settlement,
so a long response can still finish past the cap. These counters do not
include requests made outside this gateway or reconcile provider invoices.

## Tools

- **Connectivity test**: `POST /admin/api/connectivity/test` probes
  `https://1.1.1.1/cdn-cgi/trace` (IPv4 and
  IPv6) through the proxy that would apply at the chosen scope, and reports
  the egress IP, location, latency, and which proxy source was used.
- **Upstream quota**: for channels that expose it (`codex`, `claudecode`,
  `geminicli`), `GET /admin/api/credentials/<id>/quota` reports observed quota
  windows with used
  percent and period end. `POST /admin/api/credentials/<id>/quota-probe`
  probes the upstream account live;
  Codex reset credits can be consumed with `/quota-reset`.
  A credential with a live
  window at 90% or more sorts behind its peers in the same failover tier, and
  at 100% it sorts last.
- **Batch actions**: `POST /admin/api/batch/providers` and
  `/admin/api/batch/credentials` apply `enable`, `disable`, or `delete` with a
  per-item outcome.
- **Export / import**: a configuration export covers identity, providers,
  credentials, keys, quotas, pricing, routes, aliases, and rules. Secrets are
  omitted unless requested; a secret-bearing export records whether it was
  plaintext or sealed and under which key fingerprint. Import re-seals under
  the local key and reports skipped credentials and keys.

Models, pull-from-upstream, and the model test are covered in
[Models, Routes & Aliases](/guides/models/).
